        <p class="p">
                   At Caraga State University-Main Campus, we are committed to
          providing a world-class educational experience for our students,
          faculty, and staff. We understand that the quality of campus
          facilities and services plays a pivotal role in shaping this
          experience. To uphold our commitment to excellence, we have introduced
          the <span>UniVoice: CSU Student Feedback Portal</span>, an internally
          developed initiative that places the voice of our campus community at
          the heart of our decision-making process.
        </p>

        <h1 class="title">Our Mission</h1>
        <p class="p">
                  To continually enhance the quality of services and facilities
          within our institution. We believe that the best way to achieve this
          goal is by actively seeking feedback from those who matter most – you,
          the members of our campus community.
        </p>
        <hr class="line" />

        <p class="p">
          <br />We invite you to be an active participant in this journey of
          improvement. Your feedback is not just a suggestion – it's a powerful
          tool for making a difference in the quality of your educational
          experience. Together, we can create a campus environment that not only
          meets but exceeds your expectations.

          <br /><br />Thank you for being a part of our commitment to excellence
          in campus facilities and services. Your voice matters, and your input
          is the catalyst for positive change.
